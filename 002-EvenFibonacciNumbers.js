//PROJECT EULER: PROBLEM 2 EVEN FIBONACCI NUMBERS
//COMPLETED 8/26/14 ORIGINALLY (NOT SHOWN)
//COMPLETED 6/5/15 OPTIMIZED (BELOW)
//ANSWER: 4613732


// Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

// 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

// By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

var fib = function(num) {
    if (num === 1 || num === 2) {
        return num;
    } else {
        return fib(num-1) + fib(num-2);
    }   
}


var fibSum = function(limit) {
    var sum = 0;
    var index = 1;
    var curr = fib(index);
    
    while (curr < limit) {
        curr = fib(index);
        if (curr % 2 === 0) {
            sum += curr;
        }
        index++;
    }
