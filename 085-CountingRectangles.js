//PROJECT EULER: PROBLEM 85 COUNTING RECTANGLES
//NOT COMPLETED


// By counting carefully it can be seen that a rectangular grid measuring 3 by 2 contains eighteen rectangles:

// Although there exists no rectangular grid that contains exactly two million rectangles, find the area of the grid with the nearest solution.


var countRectangles = function(height, width) {
   var count = 0;
   var area = height * width;

   for (var i = 1; i<=height; i++) {
     for (var j = 1; j<=width; j++) {
       count += 
     }
   }
